This repository is a **fork** of the original *EduNex – Interactive Learning Mentorship Platform* project.

## Overview
I contributed to this project as part of a group collaboration.  
This fork is maintained to document my contributions and for further development and reference.

## Project Documentation
This repository includes comprehensive project documentation for reference.  
A detailed PDF file is provided that describes the complete feature set, system functionality, and module-level details.  
Additionally, a PNG image containing the class diagram is included to illustrate the system architecture and class relationships.

## My Contributions
I worked on the **Mentorship & Discussion module**, which focuses on communication and academic guidance within the platform.  
Implemented features include:

- **Discussion Forum** – Course-specific boards where students can post questions  
- **Reply System** – Instructors and peers can respond to questions  
- **Upvote & Helpful Marking** – Users can upvote and mark best answers  
- **Mentorship Session Scheduling** – One-on-one session scheduling with instructors
