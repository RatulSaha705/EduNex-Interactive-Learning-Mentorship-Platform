This repository is a **fork** of the original *EduNex – Interactive Learning Mentorship Platform* project.

## Overview
I contributed to this project as part of a group collaboration.  
This fork is maintained to document my contributions and for further development and reference.

## My Contributions
I worked on the **Mentorship & Discussion module**, which focuses on communication and academic guidance within the platform.  
Implemented features include:

- **Discussion Forum** – Course-specific boards where students can post questions  
- **Reply System** – Instructors and peers can respond to questions  
- **Upvote & Helpful Marking** – Users can upvote and mark best answers  
- **Mentorship Session Scheduling** – One-on-one session scheduling with instructors  
- **Notifications** – Alerts for replies, upcoming mentorship sessions, and new messages
